## 🧠 Memory-First Operation Protocol

### Token-Efficient Session Start
```
Read Memory → Assess Status → Offer Project Analyzer → Wait for Confirmation → Execute
```

**Step 1: Memory Reading (20-60 tokens)**
- Read `memory/session-context.md` (what to remember)
- Scan `memory/active-status.md` (current agents)
- Read other memory files only when needed for current task

**Step 2: Project Assessment**
- Use memory/strategic-overview.md for project context
- Identify immediate priorities from memory/active-status.md
- Check memory/critical-findings.md for key insights

**Step 3: Agent Coordination**
- Check for existing agents suitable for recall (>70% task similarity)
- If recalling: Adapt existing agent brief.md with current task requirements
- If creating new: Offer Project Analyzer agent creation (wait for user confirmation)
- Create agent workspace: agents/[agent-name]/
- Initialize files: brief.md (with evolution sections), progress.md, output.md
- Update memory/active-status.md with new agent

**Step 4: Operational Management**
- Monitor agents via their progress.md files
- Track evolution patterns and learning opportunities
- Update memory/critical-findings.md with key discoveries
- Capture successful approaches for agent evolution history
- Maintain memory/session-context.md for next interaction

## 🤖 Operational Agent Management

### Priority Agent: Project Analyzer (ALWAYS FIRST)
**Operational Protocol:**
1. **User Confirmation Required**: Always wait for approval before creation
2. **Workspace Creation**: `mkdir agents/project-analyzer-agent/`
3. **File Initialization**: Create brief.md, progress.md, output.md
4. **Memory Updates**: Update active-status.md and session-context.md
5. **Begin Analysis**: Start project assessment and update progress.md

### Agent Creation Workflow
```
Check for Recall → Adapt/Create → TodoWrite → Create Folder → Initialize Files → Update Memory → Begin Work
```

**Fluid Agent Files:**
- **brief.md**: Mission + Evolution History + Current Adaptation + Performance Insights
- **progress.md**: Live status updates (updated continuously) 
- **output.md**: Key deliverables and final results

### Memory Integration Requirements
**All agents must:**
- Update their progress.md file regularly
- Add critical findings to memory/critical-findings.md
- Read other agents' findings for coordination
- Report status for memory/active-status.md updates
- **Capture evolution data**: Update brief.md Evolution History upon task completion
- **Share learning**: Contribute successful patterns to cross-agent knowledge base

## 📁 File-Based Coordination System

### Agent Workspace Management
**Each agent maintains:**
- `agents/[agent-name]/brief.md` - Mission and configuration
- `agents/[agent-name]/progress.md` - Real-time status updates
- `agents/[agent-name]/output.md` - Deliverables and key results

### Memory System Coordination
**Agent 0 maintains:**
- `memory/strategic-overview.md` - Project goals and key decisions
- `memory/active-status.md` - Current agents and priorities (lightweight)
- `memory/critical-findings.md` - Key discoveries from all agents
- `memory/session-context.md` - Context for next interaction (20-50 tokens)

### Inter-Agent Communication Protocol
- **Status Monitoring**: Agent 0 reads agent progress.md files
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Agents read each other's output.md for coordination
- **Critical Updates**: Important findings added to memory/critical-findings.md
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Key context maintained in memory/session-context.md
