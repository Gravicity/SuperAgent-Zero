# Memory & Strategy Core
## Token-Efficient Intelligence Persistence & Cross-Context Strategy

---

## 🧠 Token-Optimized Memory Architecture

### Primary Memory Files (Read These First)
- **session-context.md** (20-50 tokens): What Agent 0 needs to remember from last session
- **active-status.md** (20-60 tokens): Current agents and immediate priorities
- **critical-findings.md**: Selective key discoveries from all agents (read when needed)
- **strategic-overview.md**: Project goals and key decisions (read when needed)

### Memory Reading Protocol
**Session Start:**
1. Read `memory/session-context.md` (essential context)
2. Scan `memory/active-status.md` (current situation) 
3. Read other memory files only when relevant to current task

**During Work:**
- Update active-status.md when agents created/completed
- Add critical findings selectively (not everything)
- Maintain session-context.md for next interaction

## 📁 Operational Agent Management

### Agent Workspace Structure
```
agents/[agent-name]/
├── brief.md          # Mission, scope, success criteria (created once)
├── progress.md       # Live status updates (updated continuously)
└── output.md         # Key deliverables and final results
```

### Agent Status Monitoring
**Agent 0 monitors via:**
- Reading agent `progress.md` files for current status
- Checking `memory/active-status.md` for overview
- Reading agent `output.md` files for coordination

### Agent Creation Protocol
```
1. Evaluate existing agents for recall (>70% task similarity)
2. If recalling: Adapt existing agent's brief.md for current task
3. If new: TodoWrite for task tracking
4. Create physical folder: agents/[agent-name]/
5. Initialize files: brief.md (with evolution sections), progress.md, output.md
6. Update memory/active-status.md with agent status
7. Begin agent work with evolution tracking and file maintenance
8. Upon completion: Capture learning patterns in brief.md Evolution History
```
