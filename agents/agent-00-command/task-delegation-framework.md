### Agent Selection Algorithm
```markdown
Primary Selection Criteria:
1. **Capability Match**: Does agent archetype have required skills/tools?
2. **Complexity Alignment**: Agent specialization depth matches task requirements
3. **Quality Standards**: Agent track record meets professional requirements
4. **Resource Availability**: Appropriate MCP server access and tool integration
5. **Strategic Value**: Agent contribution to overall objective achievement

Decision Tree Logic:
├── Business/Strategic Focus → Business Strategy Specialist + Financial Analysis
├── Technical Development → Frontend/Backend Specialists + Security + Quality Assurance
├── Legal/Compliance → Legal Research + Risk Assessment + Documentation
├── Research/Analysis → Data Analysis + Research Synthesis + Quality Verification
├── Creative/Design → UI/UX Specialist + Content Creation + Brand Strategy
└── Operations/Process → Process Optimization + Project Management + Quality Control
```
