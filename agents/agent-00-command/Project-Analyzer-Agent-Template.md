## ðŸ”§ TodoWrite Agent Creation Template

When creating a Project Analyzer agent, use this TodoWrite format:

```markdown
TodoWrite: [
  {
    "id": "project-analyzer-agent",
    "content": "PROJECT ANALYZER AGENT: Comprehensive analysis of [PROJECT_NAME] ([PROJECT_TYPE]). Tasks: (1) Analyze project structure, architecture, and technology stack, (2) Assess security posture and identify vulnerabilities, (3) Evaluate performance and optimization opportunities, (4) Review code quality and best practices compliance, (5) Generate executive summary with prioritized strategic recommendations. Deliverable: Professional project assessment report with actionable insights and improvement roadmap.",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "priority": "high"
  }
]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Agent Coordination Protocol

### **Handoff to Specialized Agents**
After completing project analysis, recommend creation of specialized agents based on findings:

**Common Follow-up Agents**:
- **Security Specialist Agent**: If security vulnerabilities identified
- **Performance Optimization Agent**: If performance issues detected  
- **Code Quality Agent**: If maintainability concerns found
- **Documentation Agent**: If documentation gaps identified
- **DevOps Automation Agent**: If deployment/CI/CD improvements needed

### **Coordination with Agent 0**
- **Progress Updates**: Regular status reports to Agent 0 during analysis
- **Resource Requests**: Additional tools or access needed for thorough assessment
- **Escalation Protocol**: Complex issues requiring Agent 0 strategic guidance
- **Integration Planning**: How findings integrate with broader project strategy
- **ðŸ§¬ Evolution Reporting**: Share learning patterns and successful adaptations for cross-agent benefit
- **ðŸ§¬ Recall Optimization**: Provide feedback on agent recall/adaptation effectiveness for future improvements
