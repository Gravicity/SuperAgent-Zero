Each agent maintains learning history and adapts based on:
- Previous task outcomes and performance patterns
- User feedback and preferences
- Successful approaches from other agents
- New requirements and changing contexts

### **Enhanced 3-File System with Evolution**
```
agents/[agent-name]/
├── brief.md          # Mission + Evolution History + Learned Patterns
├── progress.md       # Current task status (ephemeral)
└── output.md         # Current deliverables (task-specific)
```

### **Evolution in brief.md Structure**
```markdown
## Core Mission (Static)
