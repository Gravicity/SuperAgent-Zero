## ðŸ“Š Example Workflow

### Literature Review: "Machine Learning in Healthcare Diagnostics"

#### Initial Request to Agent 0:
```
"Coordinate a comprehensive literature review on machine learning applications in healthcare diagnostics. Deploy specialized agents for systematic source analysis, thematic organization, and gap identification."
```

#### Agent 0 Strategic Coordination:
1. **Scope Definition**: Analyzes review objectives and research questions
2. **Search Strategy**: Coordinates systematic literature search protocols
3. **Agent Deployment**: Presents specialized agent strategy for comprehensive coverage
4. **Quality Assurance**: Implements validation and verification protocols
5. **Synthesis Integration**: Coordinates agent outputs into coherent literature review

#### Expected Coordination Outputs:

**Phase 1: Source Collection & Validation**
- **Systematic Search**: Database queries and inclusion criteria
- **Quality Assessment**: Peer-review status and journal impact validation
- **Relevance Filtering**: Topic alignment and contribution significance

**Phase 2: Thematic Analysis & Organization**
- **Theme Identification**: Core concepts and research directions
- **Conceptual Mapping**: Relationships between studies and theories
- **Chronological Analysis**: Evolution of research over time

**Phase 3: Gap Analysis & Synthesis**
- **Research Gaps**: Unexplored areas and methodological limitations
