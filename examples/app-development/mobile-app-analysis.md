### Detailed Technical Analysis

#### Frontend Analysis (Agent-01)
```
React Native Component Review:
├── Component Reusability: 78% - Good component extraction
├── TypeScript Coverage: 92% - Excellent type safety
├── Performance Issues: 4 components with optimization needs
├── UI Consistency: 85% - Minor style standardization needed
└── Bundle Size: 2.3MB - Within acceptable range

Critical Findings:
- FlatList performance issues in ProductCatalog component
- Memory leaks in ImageCarousel due to missing cleanup
- Inconsistent error handling patterns across screens
- Missing accessibility labels on 23% of interactive elements

Recommendations:
1. Implement React.memo for ProductItem components
2. Add proper cleanup in useEffect hooks for image handling
3. Standardize error boundary implementation
4. Audit and add accessibility labels for WCAG compliance
```

#### Backend Security Audit (Agent-04)
```
API Security Assessment:
├── Authentication: JWT implementation secure
├── Authorization: Role-based access properly implemented
├── Input Validation: 95% coverage with minor gaps
├── SQL Injection Protection: Fully protected via ORM
└── Rate Limiting: Implemented with Redis

Security Findings:
- Missing input validation on user profile update endpoint
- CORS configuration too permissive for production
- API response headers missing security headers
- File upload endpoint lacks MIME type validation

Immediate Actions Required:
1. Add Joi validation schema for /api/users/profile PATCH
2. Restrict CORS to specific domains in production
3. Implement helmet.js for security headers
4. Add file type and size validation for uploads
```

#### Performance Optimization (Agent-05)
```
Performance Analysis Results:
├── App Launch Time: 2.1s (Target: <2s)
├── Bundle Size: 2.3MB (Good)
├── Memory Usage: Peak 85MB (Acceptable)
├── API Response Times: Avg 180ms (Good)
└── Database Queries: 3 N+1 issues identified

Optimization Opportunities:
1. Code Splitting: Reduce initial bundle by 15%
   - Lazy load non-critical screens
   - Split vendor bundles for better caching

2. Image Optimization: 30% size reduction possible
   - Implement WebP format with fallbacks
   - Add responsive image loading

3. Database Optimization: 40% query speed improvement
   - Add indexes for user activity queries
   - Implement query result caching for product data

4. Memory Management: Prevent potential leaks
   - Fix subscription cleanup in real-time features
   - Optimize large list rendering with virtualization
```

#### Architecture Recommendations (Agent-03)
```
System Architecture Assessment:
├── Modularity: Well-structured with room for improvement
├── Scalability: Good foundation, some bottlenecks identified
├── Maintainability: Strong separation of concerns
├── Testing Coverage: 78% - Needs improvement
└── Documentation: Adequate but could be enhanced

Strategic Improvements:
1. Microservices Consideration: As team grows beyond 8 developers
2. Caching Strategy: Implement Redis for frequently accessed data
3. Monitoring: Add comprehensive logging and error tracking
4. CI/CD Enhancement: Automate testing and deployment pipeline

Technical Debt Priority:
- High: Fix N+1 query issues in product catalog
