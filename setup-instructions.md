# SuperAgent Zero Setup Instructions
## Complete Installation and Configuration Guide

---

## 🎯 Overview

SuperAgent Zero uses a two-phase installation process:
1. **Global Installation** (one-time): Install framework globally for use across all projects
2. **Project Initialization** (per-project): Activate SuperAgent Zero capabilities in specific projects

This approach allows you to enhance Claude Code's capabilities in any project without being limited to a specific directory.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Software
- [ ] **Claude Code CLI** (Latest version from Anthropic)
- [ ] **Git** (For framework installation and updates)
- [ ] **Node.js** v18+ (For MCP server support)
- [ ] **Terminal/Command Line Access**

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check installations
claude-code --version    # Should show Claude Code version
git --version           # Should show Git version  
node --version          # Should show v18.0.0 or higher
```

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Global Installation (One-Time)

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# One-command installation
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/SuperAgent-Zero/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SuperAgent-Zero.git
cd SuperAgent-Zero

# Run installation script
./install.sh
```

### Installation Verification
```bash
# Validate installation
~/.superagent-zero/bin/validate.sh

# Check version
cat ~/.superagent-zero/VERSION
```

The global installation creates:
```
~/.superagent-zero/
├── framework/               # Core SuperAgent Zero components
├── setup.sh                # Project initialization script  
├── bin/                    # Utility scripts (update, validate)
├── VERSION                 # Framework version
└── framework-registry.json # Installation metadata
```

---

## 🎯 Phase 2: Project Usage (Per-Project)

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Navigate to ANY existing project
cd ~/my-important-project

# Start Claude Code
claude-code

# Initialize SuperAgent Zero  
> "Initialize SuperAgent Zero for this project"
```

### What Happens During Initialization
1. **Project Analysis**: Detects project type (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
2. **Workspace Creation**: Creates `.superagent/` folder in your project
3. **Agent 0 Activation**: Claude becomes superintelligence command center
4. **Capability Enhancement**: Loads specialized templates and protocols
5. **Context Setting**: Provides immediate project understanding

### Project Workspace Structure
```
your-project/
├── .superagent/            # SuperAgent workspace (created automatically)
│   ├── config/            # Project-specific configuration
│   ├── agents/            # Active agents for this project  
│   ├── memory/            # Persistent context and learning
│   └── workspace/         # Agent outputs and working files
├── [your existing files]  # Claude can work on your actual project
└── [existing structure]   # No disruption to your workflow
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### MCP Server Configuration

SuperAgent Zero automatically configures MCP servers based on your project type, but you can customize:

```bash
# Edit MCP configuration
nano your-project/.superagent/config/mcp-servers.json
```

### Recommended MCP Servers by Project Type

#### Node.js Projects
```json
{
  "recommended_servers": [
    "filesystem",
    "code-analysis", 
    "security-scanner",
    "performance-monitor"
  ]
}
```

#### Python Projects  
```json
{
  "recommended_servers": [
    "filesystem",
    "statistical-analysis",
    "data-visualization", 
    "research-database"
  ]
}
```

#### Document/Legal Projects
```json
{
  "recommended_servers": [
    "filesystem",
    "pdf-processor",
    "document-analysis",
    "citation-manager"
  ]
}
```

### Installing MCP Servers

#### NPM-based Servers
```bash
# Core MCP servers
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-web-search
```

#### Docker-based Servers (Recommended)
```bash
# Pull recommended Docker containers
docker pull mcp-pdf-extraction:latest
docker pull mcp-statistical-analysis:latest  
docker pull mcp-research-database:latest

# Verify containers
docker images | grep mcp-
```

## 🛠️ Maintenance & Updates

### Update Framework
```bash
# Update to latest version
~/.superagent-zero/bin/update.sh

# Or reinstall completely
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/SuperAgent-Zero/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Validate Installation
```bash
# Check framework health
~/.superagent-zero/bin/validate.sh

# Check specific project workspace
cd your-project
~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh --validate
```

### Reset Project Workspace
```bash
# If project workspace becomes corrupted
cd your-project
rm -rf .superagent/

# Then reinitialize
claude-code
> "Initialize SuperAgent Zero for this project"
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Framework Not Found
```bash
# Symptom: "SuperAgent Zero not installed globally"
# Solution: Install or reinstall framework
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/SuperAgent-Zero/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Claude Code Not Recognizing Commands
```bash
# Symptom: Claude doesn't understand SuperAgent Zero commands
# Solution: Ensure you've initialized in the project
cd your-project
claude-code
> "Initialize SuperAgent Zero for this project"
```

#### MCP Servers Not Connecting
```bash
# Symptom: MCP server errors or timeouts
# Check Docker status
docker --version && docker ps

# Check Node.js MCP servers
npm list -g | grep @modelcontextprotocol
```

#### Project Workspace Issues
```bash
# Symptom: Workspace corruption or permission errors
# Solution: Reset workspace
rm -rf .superagent/
~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Slow Response Times
1. **Check MCP server health**: Ensure all configured servers are running
2. **Reduce concurrent operations**: Limit simultaneous agent creation
3. **Clear temporary files**: Clean `.superagent/workspace/temp/`

#### Memory Usage
1. **Monitor workspace size**: Large workspaces may impact performance
2. **Archive old outputs**: Move completed analysis to separate storage
3. **Optimize MCP configuration**: Remove unused server configurations

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Project Organization
- **Keep workspaces project-specific**: Each project should have its own `.superagent/` folder
- **Use descriptive agent names**: Name agents based on their specific function
- **Maintain memory files**: Let SuperAgent Zero build project understanding over time
- **Regular framework updates**: Keep global framework current for latest improvements

### Quality Assurance
- **Verify agent outputs**: Review generated analysis and recommendations
- **Maintain source documentation**: Ensure all facts are properly referenced
- **Use appropriate quality protocols**: Configure standards for your industry/domain
- **Regular validation**: Periodically validate framework installation health

### Performance Optimization
- **Project-appropriate MCP servers**: Only configure servers you actually need
- **Regular workspace cleanup**: Archive completed work to maintain performance
- **Strategic agent deployment**: Deploy agents based on actual project needs
- **Monitor resource usage**: Watch for high CPU/memory usage patterns
