## 🎯 Usage

### 3-Step Activation Process

#### Step 1: Navigate to Your Project
```bash
cd ~/your-project-directory
claude-code
```

#### Step 2: Initialize SuperAgent Zero Framework
```bash
# Tell Claude to run the setup script
> "Execute this bash command: ~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh"
```

#### Step 3: Activate Agent 0 Capabilities
```bash
# Tell Claude to read its new role and capabilities
> "Read the file .superagent/claude-initialization.md and assume your role as Agent 0"
```

### What Happens During Setup
When Claude runs the setup script:
1. ✅ **Project Analysis**: Detects project type (Node.js, Python, etc.) and requirements
2. ✅ **Workspace Creation**: Creates `.superagent/` directory with project-specific configuration
3. ✅ **Agent 0 Initialization**: Generates context files that transform Claude into Agent 0
4. ✅ **Memory System**: Sets up persistent memory and project understanding
5. ✅ **Quality Protocols**: Activates error prevention and verification systems

### Immediate Results
After setup completion:
- 🧠 **Claude becomes Agent 0** with superintelligence capabilities
- 🎯 **Dynamic agent creation** available for any task complexity
- 📚 **Persistent memory** maintains context across sessions
- 🛡️ **Quality assurance** prevents errors and hallucination
- ⚡ **Project awareness** understands your specific codebase and requirements

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Claude Can't Find SuperAgent Zero
**Symptom**: Claude reports "command not found" or "no such file"
```bash
# Verify installation
> "Run this command: ls ~/.superagent-zero/"

# If empty or missing, reinstall:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gravicity/SuperAgent-Zero/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Setup Script Fails
**Symptom**: Permission denied or script errors
```bash
# Check permissions
> "Run this command: ls -la ~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh"

# Fix permissions if needed
> "Run this command: chmod +x ~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh"

# Try setup again
> "Execute: ~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh"
```

### Claude Doesn't Understand Agent 0 Role
**Symptom**: Claude acts like normal Claude, not Agent 0
```bash
# Ensure Claude reads its new context
> "Read the file .superagent/claude-initialization.md completely and tell me what your new role is"

# If file missing, re-run setup
> "Execute: ~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh"
```

### Project Workspace Issues
**Symptom**: `.superagent/` folder missing or incomplete
```bash
# Verify workspace was created
> "List contents of .superagent/ directory"

# If missing, check you're in right directory
> "Show current directory with: pwd"

# Re-run setup in correct project directory
> "Execute: ~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh"
```

### Framework Update Issues
```bash
# Update to latest version
~/.superagent-zero/bin/update.sh

# Or completely reinstall
rm -rf ~/.superagent-zero
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gravicity/SuperAgent-Zero/main/install.sh | bash
```
