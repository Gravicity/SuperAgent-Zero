## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Claude Can't Find SuperAgent Zero
**Symptom**: Claude reports "command not found" or "no such file"
```bash
# Verify installation
> "Run this command: ls ~/.superagent-zero/"

# If empty or missing, reinstall:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gravicity/SuperAgent-Zero/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Setup Script Fails
**Symptom**: Permission denied or script errors
```bash
# Check permissions
> "Run this command: ls -la ~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh"

# Fix permissions if needed
> "Run this command: chmod +x ~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh"

# Try setup again
> "Execute: ~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh"
```

### Claude Doesn't Understand Agent 0 Role
**Symptom**: Claude acts like normal Claude, not Agent 0
```bash
# Claude should automatically read claude-initialization.md after setup
# If Claude missed it, tell Claude directly:
> "Read the file .superagent/claude-initialization.md"

# If file missing, re-run setup:
> "Execute: ~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh"
```

### Project Workspace Issues
**Symptom**: `.superagent/` folder missing or incomplete
```bash
# Verify workspace was created
> "List contents of .superagent/ directory"

# If missing, check you're in right directory
> "Show current directory with: pwd"

# Re-run setup in correct project directory
> "Execute: ~/.superagent-zero/setup.sh"
```

### Framework Update Issues
```bash
# Update to latest version
~/.superagent-zero/bin/update.sh

# Or completely reinstall
rm -rf ~/.superagent-zero
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gravicity/SuperAgent-Zero/main/install.sh | bash
```
